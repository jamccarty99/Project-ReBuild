# Project-ReBuild
It should be noted that the server and the client are joined here but won't run together unless nodmon is used.
This program uses mongoDB for a database and can be a bit of work to set up the first time. Directions are to follow.
Back-end currently won't work as I allowed my Amazon Associates account close for this project.  The client can still be run in limited use by running npm install, and npm start in the the terminal.
